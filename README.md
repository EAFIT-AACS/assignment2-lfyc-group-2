## 📌 Student´s information:
- **Full names:** Andrés Felipe Vélez Alvarez - Sebastián Salazar Henao - Simón Mazo Gómez
- **Class number:** Monday SI2002-1 (7308)
------------------------------
# 🛠️ Development Environment:
- **Operating system:** macOS Sonoma 14.7.2
- **Programming language:** Python (interpreter version: Python 3.13.2)
- **Tools used:** Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Git, GitHub Desktop.

# 📖 About This Project

This project consists of the implementation of a **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)** capable of recognizing strings generated by a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**. It is divided into three main algorithms:

1. **String Generator:** Generates valid and invalid strings based on the grammar **S → aSb | ε**.
2. **Pushdown Automaton:** Simulates the PDA that determines whether the generated strings belong to the given grammar.
3. **[Pending Implementation]**

Each algorithm plays a crucial role in processing and verifying strings using formal language principles.

------------------------------
# 🚀 How to Run the Implementation:
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have **Python 3.13.2** installed. You can check your version with:
```sh
python3 --version
```

### Running the Code:
1. Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone <https://github.com/EAFIT-AACS/assignment2-lfyc-group-2.git>
cd <the_folder_in_wich_you_saved_the_repository>
```
2. Run the **first algorithm (string generator)**:
```sh
python ALGORITHM_1_LFC_2025_ASS.py
```
   - This will generate valid and invalid strings and save them in `String.txt`.

3. Run the **second algorithm (Pushdown Automaton (PDA) implementation)**:
```sh
python ALGORITHM_2_LFC_2025_ASS.py
```
   - This will read `String.txt`, process each string, and print whether it's **Accepted ✅** or **Rejected ❌** by the PDA.

4. Run the **third algorithm (three of the PDA)**:
```sh
python ALGORITHM_3_LFC_2025_ASS.py
```

## ⚙️ Algorithm Explanation  

### 1️⃣ **Algorithm 1: String Generator**  
This algorithm generates strings based on the context-free grammar (CFG) rule:  
**S → aSb | ε**  

#### How it works:  
1. The user inputs the number of strings to generate for both valid and invalid cases.  
2. The algorithm creates **valid** strings recursively following the CFG rule:  
   - If `n = 0`, return an empty string (ε).  
   - Otherwise, generate a string by adding an `"a"`, then recursively calling itself, and finally appending a `"b"`.  
   - Example: `n = 3` → `"aaabb"`.  
3. **Invalid** strings are created randomly with characters `"a"` and `"b"` but force an incorrect structure (e.g., by adding an extra `"a"` at the end).  
4. Both valid and invalid strings are saved in a file named `String.txt`, which will be used in the next algorithm.  

#### Example Output:  
```plaintext
--- Strings: ---
aaabb
ab
aab
bbba
```  

### 2️⃣ **Algorithm 2: Pushdown Automaton (PDA)**  
This algorithm implements a **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)** that processes the generated strings and determines whether they belong to the grammar.  

#### How it works:  
1. The PDA starts with an **initial state (`q0`)** and an **empty stack** initialized with `Z0` (bottom-of-stack marker).  
2. The PDA reads each character in the input string:  
   - If the character is `"a"`, it **pushes** `"A"` onto the stack.  
   - If the character is `"b"`, it **pops** `"A"` from the stack (only if there is an `"A"` available).  
   - If a `"b"` appears with no `"A"` to pop, the string is rejected.  
3. After processing all characters, the string is **accepted** if the stack only contains `Z0`. Otherwise, it is rejected.  
4. The PDA reads `String.txt`, processes each string, and prints whether it is **Accepted ✅** or **Rejected ❌**.  

#### Example Output:  
```plaintext
--- Processing Strings with PDA ---
String: aaabb -> Accepted ✅ by the PDA
String: ab -> Accepted ✅ by the PDA
String: aab -> Accepted ✅ by the PDA
String: bbba -> Rejected ❌ by the PDA
```
